# Angular Signals Example

This project demonstrates the use of Angular Signals, a new reactive state management feature introduced in Angular. It provides a reactive programming model using signals to manage state and computed properties, making it easier to create reactive, data-driven applications.

## Features

- **Signals**: Reactive state management for variables like `quantity` and `qtyAvailable`.
- **Computed**: Derived values, like `multiplication`, that automatically update when dependent signals change.
- **Effect**: Side effects (such as logging) triggered when a signal value changes.
- **Angular Forms**: Reactive form input to modify the state of signals in the UI.
